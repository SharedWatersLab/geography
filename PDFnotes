testing PDF process notes

* first i had to dig up the excel to pdf conversion
* so I might later need to do some conversion also - 
    * I have a csv script and I have an excel to pdf script
    * may need to do both or better yet combine them.
    * workin on branch selena_updates
* and fun fact now I know what I changed in basinclass it was just the tigris url (copy from 0612)
* needed to change a couple things in the script
* needed to have the pdf csv
* date in csv needs to be yyyy (have been doing this manually), I think because the csv itâ€™s converting from is also not reading correctly. maybe read date cols as string
* need to have downloads/tigr/pdf folder
* filename needs update, I think
    * copy over code in filename
